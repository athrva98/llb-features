# LLB Features: Local Laplace-Beltrami Features for Point Clouds

## Introduction

LLB Features is a C++ library for computing Local Laplace-Beltrami (LLB) features on point clouds. The Laplace-Beltrami operator is a generalization of the Laplace operator to manifolds, providing a way to analyze the intrinsic geometry of surfaces represented as point clouds.

### What are Laplace-Beltrami Features?

Laplace-Beltrami features capture local and global geometric properties of a surface. They are:

- Invariant to isometric deformations (bending without stretching)
- Robust to noise and sampling density variations
- Capable of encoding multi-scale information about the surface

These properties make LLB features particularly useful in various point cloud processing tasks.

### Applications

1. **Point Cloud Registration**: LLB features can be used as descriptors for finding correspondences between different point clouds, aiding in alignment and registration tasks.

2. **Segmentation**: The features can help distinguish between different geometric regions, facilitating segmentation of point clouds into meaningful parts.

3. **Shape Classification**: LLB features provide a compact representation of local geometry, useful for training machine learning models for shape classification.

4. **Feature Detection**: They can be used to identify keypoints or interesting regions in a point cloud based on geometric properties.

5. **Shape Retrieval**: In large databases of 3D models, LLB features can be used to efficiently search for similar shapes.

6. **Surface Reconstruction**: The features can guide surface reconstruction algorithms by providing information about local geometry.

## Characteristics of this Implementation

- Computes Local Laplace-Beltrami features for 3D point clouds

## Usage

To use LLB Features in your project, include the `llb_features.hpp` header and link against Eigen and nanoflann.

Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <llb_features.hpp>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

// Utility function to convert std::vector<Eigen::Vector3f> to LLB Features format
template<typename T>
std::vector<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>, Eigen::aligned_allocator<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>>> convertStdEigenVectorToLLB(const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3f>& cloud)
{
    std::vector<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>, Eigen::aligned_allocator<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>>> llb_points;
    llb_points.reserve(cloud.size());
    for (const auto& point: cloud) {
        llb_points.emplace_back(point.cast<T>());
    }
    return llb_points;
}


int main() {
    // Create a simple point cloud (replace this with your actual point cloud data)
    std::vector<Eigen::Vector3f> point_cloud = {
        {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f},
        {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f},
        {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f},
        {0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f}
    };

    // Create an instance of LLBFeatures
    llb_features::LLBFeatures<float> llb(convertStdEigenVectorToLLB(point_cloud));

    // Compute the features
    auto features = llb.computeFeatures();

    // Print the features
    for (size_t i = 0; i < features.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << "Features for point " << i << ":\n" << features[i] << "\n\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Usage with Open3D

LLB Features can be easily integrated with Open3D point clouds. Here's an example of how to use LLB Features with an Open3D point cloud:

```cpp
#include <open3d/Open3D.h>
#include <llb_features.hpp>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using PointCloud = open3d::geometry::PointCloud;

// Utility function to convert Open3D point cloud to LLB Features format
template<typename T>
std::vector<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>, Eigen::aligned_allocator<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>>> convertOpen3DToLLB(const PointCloud& cloud)
{
    std::vector<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>, Eigen::aligned_allocator<Eigen::Matrix<T, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1>>> llb_points;
    llb_points.reserve(cloud.points_.size());
    for (const auto& point: cloud.points_) {
        llb_points.emplace_back(point.cast<T>());
    }
    return llb_points;
}

int main() {
    // Load a point cloud using Open3D
    auto pcd = open3d::io::CreatePointCloudFromFile("path/to/your/pointcloud.ply");

    // Convert Open3D point cloud to LLB Features format
    auto llb_points = convertOpen3DToLLB<float>(*pcd);

    // Create an instance of LLBFeatures
    llb_features::LLBFeatures<float> llb(llb_points);

    // Compute the features
    auto features = llb.computeFeatures();

    // Print the first few features
    std::cout << "Features for the first 5 points:\n";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < std::min(size_t(5), features.size()); ++i) {
        std::cout << "Point " << i << ":\n" << features[i].transpose() << "\n\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
